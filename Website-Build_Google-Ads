I need to create a service-based website that is fully optimized for Google Ads. Please help me implement the following critical components:

## Website Purpose
- Industry: [SPECIFY: e.g., home remodeling, plumbing, legal services]
- Service area: [SPECIFY: e.g., Columbia SC & Charlotte NC]
- Primary conversion goals: [SPECIFY: phone calls, form submissions, email contacts]
- Google Ads account ID: AW-[YOUR_ID]

## Technical Requirements
1. Implement proper Google Ads global site tag (gtag.js) in the <head> section of all pages
2. Create a phone click tracking system that:
   - Shows contact options modal when phone number is clicked
   - Records phone clicks as conversions in Google Ads
   - Works on all devices without JavaScript errors
   - Maintains full phone functionality while recording conversions
   - Always uses absolute URLs for tracking pixels (https://www.domain.com/tracking-file.html)

3. Set up conversion tracking for:
   - Phone calls (highest priority)
   - Form submissions
   - Email contact clicks

4. Implement SEO essentials:
   - Schema.org markup for LocalBusiness with service areas
   - Favicon implementation across all pages
   - robots.txt and sitemap.xml that includes only customer-facing pages
   - Proper meta tags on all pages

5. Create a mobile-responsive design that:
   - Maintains all tracking functionality on mobile
   - Prioritizes click-to-call buttons on mobile
   - Loads quickly on all devices

## Implementation Notes
- **Always** use absolute URLs in tracking pixels, not relative paths
- All JavaScript tracking code must be compatible with iOS Safari 
- Google Analytics and Google Ads tags must not conflict
- Include error handling in all tracking code
- Tracking files should redirect to main site after recording conversions

Please implement these requirements in the most direct, efficient way possible, focusing on reliability and conversion tracking accuracy above all.
